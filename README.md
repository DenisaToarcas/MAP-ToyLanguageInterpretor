# ToyLanguageInterpretor
Here is the implementation for an Interpretor that uses a non-specific language, considered toy language.
I implemented this project using Java, and for the GUI I used JavaFX. It uses multi-threading execution, typechecking and has a garbage collector for memory allocation.

Implementation for concurrency mechanisms are provided here:
